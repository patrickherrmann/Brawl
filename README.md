A computer version of the card game [Brawl](http://www.cheapass.com/node/72). I made this game as a prototype for two quarter long group project for school. The game uses [DeepDish](https://github.com/patrickherrmann/DeepDish) to control the animations. Human vs. human, human vs. computer, and computer vs. computer are all possible. ![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/rqzAJFu.jpg?1)
